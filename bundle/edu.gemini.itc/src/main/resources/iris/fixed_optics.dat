# Average throughput for the IRIS optics
# Columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) throughput
# The throughput cames from the on-sky performance
# from Peter McGregor (May 2011)
# Values: J: 0.60, H: 0.63, K: 0.61 (May 2011).
# Since the values were obtained with dust in AR
# window, the transmission improved a litte after
# the AR window replacement. Confirmed by the data
# obtained in 2012 April 15 and 30. Transmission
# increased by 5% in all wavelengths.
